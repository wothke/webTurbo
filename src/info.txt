	'The "pce_fast" emulation module is an experimental alternative to the pce emulation module. 
	It is a fork of 0.8.x modified for speed at the expense of (usually) unneeded accuracy(this 
	compares to the "pce" module, which traded speed away in favor of accuracy).

	To use this module rather than the "pce" module, you must either set the "pce.enable" 
	setting to "0", or pass "-force_module pce_fast" to Mednafen each time it is invoked'


notes:
	1) "trio" folder is a "a better printf"
	2) I tried to strip off stuff not used for "HES" without going into the details of the 
	   code (I hope that by cutting lose respective unused stuff, the optimized will get rid of the rest).
	   By commenting-out rather than removing, it should be easier to compare the code to 
	   future versions of the mednafen project.
